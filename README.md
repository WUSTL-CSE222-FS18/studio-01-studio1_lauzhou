# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***

Our mission is an umbrella that lights up when there is rain on the forecast for that day and flies above your head and follows you around. This would really fit into our lives because we wouldn't have to look at the weather app anymore or carry an umbrella around. We envision putting the umbrella next to the door. Then, you can forget about it until it lights up, which means that it will be rainy that day. As you walk out of the door, the umbrella will hover over you and follow you to your destination, keeping you dry without you having to hold it. If it's not already raining, it will still follow you but stay closed, and once it starts raining it will open to protect you. We wouldn't worry about forgetting it on accident since it follows you around automatically, and we wouldn't have to worry about checking the weather.

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***

boston celtics - looking for a way to get their fans at home more connected to the experience. interaction with the game to make him more invested
signed up on the app saying they're a committed fan
give back to the customers - make the customer excited whenever the celtics score - reward system

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***

1. Every time a player scores, a lucky fan from the fans who have signed up on the app and are watching the game are selected. Our services uses the data from the maps on their smartphone to locate them. Then, our services teleports the player who scored into the location that the fan is in, so they can celebrate together for a very short amount of time. Then, the player is teleported back.
  1. Strengths:
    1. Will definitely have a positive impact on fans
    1. Encourage fans to watch the games and sign up
  1. Weaknesses:
    1. Could be bad for player morale if they are always being taken out of the game
    1. Could slow down game play a locate
    1. Players could become deformed due to constant teleportation
1. Every time a player scores, a fan or fans from the list are chosen to watch the game through virtual reality. Each fan, when they sign up for the app, is given a virtual reality headset. When they are chosen, they put the headset on and get to see and experience the game from the player's perspective and act like the player for an extended period of time.
  1. Strengths:
    1. can be for more fans and for a longer period of time
  1. Weakness:
    1. Not as fun as meeting the players

## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

Feedback for solution 1: too hard to teleport a player (technically killing them) and don't want to hurt morale
Feedback for solution 2: cameras are necessary on players' heads to transmit VR, could inhibit game play

(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***

Teleportation is too difficult, so we can just do the second VR solution. We don't want any impact on the game, which cameras strapped to the players' heads could do. Therefore, we are adding a new development: contact lenses with cameras in them, so we can still record from the players' points of view, but it won't affect how they play since it won't be noticeable.

## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***

1. User Friendly
1. Innovation
1. Utility

## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***

Their criteria are 1. Feasibility, 2. Social Status, and 3. Enjoyment. They are pretty happy with our work. We definitely provide enjoyment, and it could be a sign of social status if someone was lucky enough to get to watch the game in VR. We still have to work on feasibility, but this is already better than the teleportation idea.

***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***

There's an app, and when you press the button, it activates an umbrella drone that follows you around. It's more of a subscription service which is different than what we thought, but it is pretty similar.

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
  - user Friendly
  - Feasibility
  - enjoyment
- Things
  - umbrella
  - pets
  - car
- Services
  - maps
  - watch
  - smart home
- Feedback
  - color change
  - vibrate
  - sound
- Human Actions
  - lift
  - tap
  - shake
- Missions
  - teleportation
  - telepathy
  - time-saver

### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***

1. feedback - scent
1. object - virtual reality headset
1. criteria - cost effective for customer
